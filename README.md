# Dynamic-Covariance
Models and tools for dynamic covariance structures

## Disclaimer

This package in its present form is shared to enable the reproduction of examples included in a paper submitted to the 2022 Power Systems Comutation Conference. Its use is still under development and its functionality is severly limited. We hope to extend its functionalilty in the future.
